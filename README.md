# translatorcon - Connect Translators of Central African Languages to Youth Welfare Officers

Speakers of certain Central African Languages are rare to find in Germany.
Youth welfare officers spend vast amounts of time to research for either professionals or volunteers to translate on aid plan meetings with unaccompanied asylum-seeking minors.

Translatorcon tackles the problem by a centralized platform to connect both parties Germany-wide.
